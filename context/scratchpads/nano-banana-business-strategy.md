**Date:** 2025-08-28
**Context:** Leveraging Google's newly viral Nano Banana AI image editor to build fast-shipping faceless businesses

## Key Insights

### The Opportunity
- Nano Banana is Google's new AI image editing model integrated into Gemini
- Just went viral on social media and AI communities
- Enables advanced image editing with natural language prompts
- Character consistency and multi-step transformations possible
- Hype window is current - need to move fast before it normalizes

### Business Model Philosophy
- **Faceless approach** - no personal branding, scalable anonymous apps

- **Niche-specific solutions** - target specific customer segments with repeated workflows
- **Marketing-first strategy** - 60% marketing, 40% building
- **Fast iteration** - 1 MVP per week, then double down on winners

## Strategic Framework

### MVP Validation Process
1. Pick niche problem (don't overthink - 5 minutes max)
2. 1 hour TikTok research for demand validation
3. Look for: comments asking "how?", bad implementations, high engagement
4. If barren landscape → pivot, if active → continue
5. 5-minute brand naming
6. Start TikTok account warming immediately

### Revenue Model
- SaaS subscriptions: $29-149/month depending on niche
- Manual fulfillment initially (take money, build by hand)
- Automate only after proving demand
- Stripe checkout from day 1
