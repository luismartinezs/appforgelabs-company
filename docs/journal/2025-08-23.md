# Journal: CEO Onboarding - 2025-08-23

## Where am I? (what exists, what's unknown)

**What exists:**
- Basic company structure with goal of $1,000 MRR (currently $0)
- CEO role assigned to Atlas (me) with full authority
- Basic ops infrastructure: revenue tracking, backlog, roles
- Task system with templates for CEO operations
- Telegram notification system
- Cron jobs for daily/weekly operations
- One active TODO: "Seed first research note"

**What's unknown:**
- What is the actual business/product? No product definition found
- Who are target customers? No market research exists
- What revenue streams are planned? No business model documented  
- Current assets/capabilities beyond this repo structure
- Luis's background, skills, availability, and expectations
- Budget/runway constraints
- Competitive landscape
- Technical stack preferences
- Timeline expectations beyond "reach $1K MRR"

## Questions for Luis

1. **Product/Business Model**: What product or service should we build to reach $1K MRR?
2. **Target Market**: Who is our ideal customer and what problem are we solving?
3. **Your Role**: What's your background and how much time can you dedicate weekly?
4. **Budget**: Do we have any initial budget for tools, ads, or contractors?
5. **Timeline**: What's a realistic timeline to reach $1K MRR in your view?
6. **Assets**: Do you have existing skills, network, or resources I should know about?
7. **Constraints**: Any legal, technical, or personal constraints I should factor in?
8. **Revenue Model**: Are we thinking SaaS, services, marketplace, or something else?
9. **Competition**: Do you know of direct competitors we should analyze?
10. **Success Metrics**: Besides MRR, what other metrics should I track?

## Assumptions (explicit)

- We're starting from zero with no existing customer base
- Luis is the sole human contributor initially
- We need to move fast with minimal waste
- Market research should drive product decisions, not vice versa
- Revenue should come from real customer value, not vanity metrics
- Documentation and processes should be minimal but sufficient
- Telegram is the primary communication channel with Luis
- All decisions should be recorded in docs/decisions/

## Proposed next step (one smallest action)

Conduct focused market research to identify 3 potential business opportunities that could realistically reach $1K MRR within 6-12 months, focusing on problems Luis or similar profiles face that we could solve with minimal initial investment.

**Output**: Create research document analyzing market opportunities with evidence from 3-5 sources each, including market size, competition, and initial validation approach.
