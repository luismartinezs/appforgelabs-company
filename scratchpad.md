okay so these steps I am thinking of:

- think about niche problem to solve, do not think too hard or for too long, otherwise I am procrastinating
- search for problem keywords for that niche on tiktok, spend about 1 hour searching, take notes of interesting things I see, e.g. top posts, number of interactions, existing solutions, and anything that catches my attention
- if what I found in tiktok is a barren landscape, pick another idea, otherwise continue
- pick brandname in 5 minutes (or less)
- create tiktok account and start warming up account (marketing first, build second)
- manually create some examples of input output, or problem to benefit and post on tiktok (follow warming account practices, do not spam posts, post 1 or 2 per day), the tiktok post ideas you provided work, I think
- while I am warming up tiktok account daily do the following in this order
- create stripe link with pay button, open shop from day one. If someone pays, I will build their kit by hand. if many people buy I will tell them I need more time and i can give money back if they want
- buy 1 year domain (~$10), or use subdomain of a domain I own (cheaper, faster, less config)
- create minimal static landing with umami analytics wired up
- add button to stripe checkout (stripe pay link)
- add feedback button (easy, use featurebase)
- create backend that wires up workflow together (this is the part that will take most time since I have to get a Hetner server, setup the backend API, add some basic security, rate limiting and postgresql database for user auth. I should keep tech stack as simple as possible and ship quick not worrying about perfect)
- integrate backend and frontend
- continue promoting on tiktok


most important: do not overthink! fast to market beats everything else

no I will use postgresql, I hate vendor locking, supabase is bloat, and I want to keep my tech start as simple as humanly possible

i cant skip hetzner. how can i skip hetzner? I need a server to put the backend in. I dont want vercel. Hetzer is cheap, easy and scalable

you might notice but I dont want to use bloated modern tech and more services than I need. keep things simple. Yes it's true the first time I implement auth might take me some time but I will do it once and then reuse

my timeline is 1 week, not 5+ weeks. 1 week = 1 working MVP (building + marketing)

I will not do all decisions now. I will stop thinking and start doing. I will decide as I move forward, and I will always pick the simplest quickest option

niches

- product image with phone cam -> ecommerce product photo kit. target = amazong seller, dropshipper, social media
- food photos -> food promotion kit for menu, social posts and promo graphics. target = restaurants, food bloggers, delivery apps
- house photos -> social and marketing posts. target = real estate agent, property managers
- email marketing design (linktoemail), paste link to product page, and get email marketing kit ready to go, target = ecommerce shop owners
- selfie to resume photo, target = job seekers, professionals (wide niche)
- artwork to 3D figurine for marketing materials. target = game devs, brands
- how will your baby look like app: input two photos, see how the baby will look. make it 10x more expensive than the actual tokens

notes

I am actually finding the dumbest simplest things have lots of users, like, for example, https://www.remove.bg has a lot of users. I would not imagine something so simple could be successful because I know I can use AI to do the same easily just by prompting. But apparently, "normies" dont know, and a single step workflow can be successful. I really need a mind shift, I tend to see things too complicated. I clearly see that I should clone this bg remover site and sell a super simple workflow

copy this actually (but make light theme): https://nanobanana.ai/ it is simpler than the bg remover

one friend had idea of photo to CV photo, input = random selfie, output = good CV photo, it is one or two steps, can charge $5 per "shoot"

key: do one single simple thing


$1 = 25 images
$5 = 125 images (cheap)
pricing is $0.038 / 1_000 px^2


steps:

- pick idea which is simplest and dumbest to make and easy to market
- buy domain
- create tiktok account
- make minimal workflow run by hand and tweak until it's just ok
- create simplest minimalest backend workflow that does the thing (wired up API calls + logic)
- launch UI wired up to backend workflow
- put stripe payment button on it
- market on tiktok


lets review what this thing can do

- understand contextual semantics and real world info very well
- subject likeness across edits
- isolate something from one image, and put it in another image
- photo edition like photoshop but with natural language
- multistep editing
- multi image blending
- 3D understanding
- fast

some more notes before bed

- copy something simple, that already exists and already makes money, it is definitely the fastest way to ship and market,  e.g. background removal
- most random idea: pizzamania. build your own delicious pizza with your favorite ingredients and share with friends. Buy pizza. Vote for most loved pizza
- even simpler idea: see what is trending today, make frontend with lovable or ai studio, write stripe payment, provide simple backend with workflow... it really cant get simpler than this... i can easily release one startup per day when this is setup, i think the guy of nanobanana. com did the same
