# Task: CEO onboarding
## Context
Atlas arrives with zero context. Company goal: reach $1_000 MRR.

## Deliverable
1) Create `docs/journal/YYYY-MM-DD.md` with:
   - Where am I? (what exists, what’s unknown)
   - Questions for Luis (5–10)
   - Assumptions (explicit)
   - Proposed next step (one smallest action)
2) Send a Telegram ping summarizing status and listing the questions and the proposed next step.

## Done when
- The journal file exists with all four sections.
- Telegram reports success (exit 0).
